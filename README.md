# INSC-590.001-Data-Software-Preservation-Project
The Data/Software Preservation project is a class assignment for INSC 590.001 Spring 2019.

# Data
Data is from another class (ANTH 511 Spring 2019) project involving analysis of tweets from the Clemson twitter data set containing tweets from known Russian bots. A sentiment analysis of scientific topics was examined and Granger Causality test was used to ascertain if the activity of the most prevelant accounts can predict the activity of the data set as a whole. R Studio was used for all analyses. 

The data set used was created by Clemson University researchers Darren Linvill, an associate professor of communication, and Patrick Warren, an associate professor of economics in 2018. The original data set can be found here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets
